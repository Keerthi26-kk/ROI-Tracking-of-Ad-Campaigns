# ROI Tracking of Ad Campaigns using SAS

This SAS project analyzes advertising campaign data and calculates the **Return on Investment (ROI)** for each campaign. It is designed to help marketers and analysts understand which campaigns deliver the best financial returns across different channels and regions.

## üìå What is ROI?

**Return on Investment (ROI)** is a key performance indicator used to evaluate the profitability of an investment, in this case, an advertising campaign.

### ROI Formula:

\[
\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Revenue} - \text{AdSpend}}{\text{AdSpend}}
\]

- ROI is expressed as a **percentage**.
- A positive ROI indicates a profitable campaign; a negative ROI indicates a loss.
- For example, an ROI of 1.5 means a 150% return on the initial spend.

## ‚ùì Why Use ROI in Marketing?

ROI is essential for marketers and business leaders to:

- **Measure Effectiveness**: Understand how well each campaign performs financially.
- **Optimize Budget Allocation**: Invest more in campaigns that generate high ROI.
- **Compare Channels**: Evaluate which platforms (e.g., Social Media, Email, Search) deliver the best value.
- **Support Data-Driven Decisions**: Make informed decisions about scaling or halting campaigns.
